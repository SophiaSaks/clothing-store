<b><h1>Clothing store, first created as prototypes in Figma.</h1></b>

Playing around with different ways to create a more graphical and "brand"-y site, imagining the target group to be people age 18-30 with an interest for fashion and clothing. 

Example from my prototype I used to sketch out my ideas:

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Still making it <b>responsive</b> and being able to have a mobile view that is maybe not as fleshed out but still the same graphical design.
  </li>
  <li>
    Still making sure it's as user friendly and accessible as possible, even though the project itself is a bit more experimental and more "artsy" by design. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Rendering out pages without any of the graphical elements moving around (i.e the frame I made with the pillars)
  </li>
</ul>

My idea has been to make the frame static, and make a space in the middle where I render the different content for the pages. So my plan has been to make a primary and seconary space where I render the different content depending on which "page" you're on. To make the design a bit more simple in this case (since it's already a lot of pictures and styling involved), I wanted to make every page the same kind of grid, with one bigger space for major content and the smaller, secondary space for things like filtering and such.
