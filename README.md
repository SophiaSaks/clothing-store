<b><h1>Clothing store, first created as prototypes in Figma.</h1></b>

Playing around with different ways to create a more graphical and "brand"-y site, imagining the target group to be people age 18-30 with an interest for fashion and clothing. 

Example from my prototype I used to sketch out my ideas: 

![Prototype](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5803b4cb-a97d-4a87-a19e-fe2c975afeb3)

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Still making it <b>responsive</b> and being able to have a mobile view that is maybe not as fleshed out but still the same graphical design.
  </li>
  <li>
    Still making sure it's as user friendly and accessible as possible, even though the project itself is a bit more experimental and more "artsy" by design. 
  </li>
</ul>
